# Damnit-Scott
#### An in-browser customized score tracker for the *Oh Hell* card game.




##### History
Damnit-Scott was a project I developed when learning to program.  At the time, my co-workers and I were always planning one game or another durring our lunch period.  One of the games we played a lot was the card game aptly named *Oh Hell*.  We quickly tweaked the rules to fit our tastes. We ended up playing it so much and enjoying it to the point we wanted an easier and quicker way to keep track of the score.  Being a fledgling programmer, I offered to take the project on.  This is what I came up with.
